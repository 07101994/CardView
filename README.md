## Samples
The sample you can find here https://github.com/AndreiMisiukevich/CardView/tree/master/PanCardViewSample

-> Create CardsView and setup it
```csharp
var cardsView = new CardsView
{
    ItemTemplate = new DataTemplate(() => new ContentView()) //your template
};
cardsView.SetBinding(CardsView.ItemsProperty, nameof(PanCardSampleViewModel.Items));
cardsView.SetBinding(CardsView.CurrentIndexProperty, nameof(PanCardSampleViewModel.CurrentIndex));
```
-> Optionaly you can create ViewModel... or not... as you wish

-> Indicators bar (For CarouselView, perhaps). It's easy to add indicators
-> Just add IndicatorsControl into your carouselView as a child view.

```csharp
carouselView.Children.Add(new IndicatorsControl());
```
-> If you want to customize indicators, you need set *SelectedIndicatorStyle* and/or *UnselectedIndicatorStyle*, or you are able to extend this class and override several methods.
Also you can customize position of indicators (You need to set Rotation / AbsoluteLayout Flags and Bounds etc.)

This class is describing default indicators styles (each default indicator item is Frame)

## Workarounds

-> If you want to put your cardsView/carouselView INTO scroll view, you should to use *ParentScrollView* instead of Xamarin.Forms.ScrollView.

-> If you want to put cardsView/carouselView INTO ListView or INTO any another scrollable view you should follow these steps
1) Create your own class and implement IOrdinateHandlerParentView interface (It's needede only for iOS, but do it into shared project)
2) Create the renderer for this class (For Android)

Check these classes (I implemented it for ParentScrollView. You can use it as example, nothing difficult :))
