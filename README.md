## Samples
The sample you can find here https://github.com/AndreiMisiukevich/CardView/tree/master/PanCardViewSample

-> Create CardsView and setup it
```csharp
var cardsView = new CardsView
{
    DataTemplate = new DataTemplate(() => new ContentView()) //your template
};
cardsView.SetBinding(CardsView.ItemsProperty, nameof(PanCardSampleViewModel.Items));
cardsView.SetBinding(CardsView.CurrentIndexProperty, nameof(PanCardSampleViewModel.CurrentIndex));
```
-> Optionaly you can create ViewModel... or not... as you wish

-> Indicators bar (For CarouselView, perhaps). It's easy to add indicators
-> Just add IndicatorsControl into your view as a child view.

```csharp
cardsView.Children.Add(new IndicatorsControl());
```
-> If you want to customize indicators, you need to extend IndicatorsView class and override a few methods. 
Also you can choose position for indicators (You need to set Rotation / AbsoluteLayout Flags and Bounds etc.)
